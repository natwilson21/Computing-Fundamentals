Assignment Specifications:
A string that is spelled identically backward and forward, like ‘radar’, is a palindrome. 
Write a function is_palindrome that takes a string and returns True if it’s a palindrome and False
otherwise. Your function should ignore case sensitivity (that is, ‘a’ and ‘A’ are the same), spaces, and punctuation.
